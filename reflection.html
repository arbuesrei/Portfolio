        <p style="text-align: left; max-width: 800px;">Here's my reflection as I'm about to finish high school: During my senior year of high school, I made a few new friends, and it was especially more enjoyable than my junior year, since I wasn't taking any AP or honors classes unlike junior year. What stuck out to me in ERWC was the cell phones and creativity assignments, because I realized how much time I was wasting just scrolling through social media apps. I learned during senior year to enjoy every moment, as this is the last year of high school, and the last year of school in general. Living through the 
            COVID pandemic wasn't really easy for me, and I learned to try to take care of your mental health when it's not at its best. During my time at ELCO, I mostly hung out with my middle school friends, but my friend group extended to include friends that came from other middle schools as well. One of my toughest times during my time in high school was during junior year, when I nearly failed some of my classes, and I was glad to recover from that by the end of the school year.
            What I learned about myself is that I tend to procrastinate a lot, which I'm trying to reduce, and how I've changed within the last four years was that I take care of my overall health now such as eating healthier and getting exercise. Leaving ELCO, I'll miss my teachers, some of the classmates I've met, and probably an unpopular opinion, but the structured class times. Post high school, I'm looking forward to meet new people in university and see what campus is like.
